The Student Grade Calculator is a simple console-based application designed to help students calculate their academic performance based on the marks they receive in various subjects. When the program begins, it first prompts the user to enter how many subjects they have. This allows the program to handle any number of subjects dynamically. It then asks the user to input the marks for each subject one by one. These marks are assumed to be out of 100. As the marks are entered, the program keeps a running total by adding each subject's marks to a totalMarks variable. Once all marks are collected, the program calculates the average percentage by dividing the total marks by the number of subjects. With this average percentage, the program then determines the student’s grade based on predefined grading criteria: if the average is 90 or above, the grade is A+; if it’s between 80 and 89, it’s A; 70 to 79 earns a B; 60 to 69 gets a C; 50 to 59 receives a D; and anything below 50 results in a grade of F. Finally, the program displays the total marks obtained, the calculated average percentage, and the corresponding grade, giving the user a clear summary of their academic performance. After all calculations and display, the program closes the input scanner to end the session cleanly
